Great work with exercise 1! Your comments are very clear and I can tell you thought through what every line was doing.

I don't see your exercise 2 yet, so remember to push it to your GitHub repo by the time the bootcamp work is due. Remember that for this exercise, we just want a count of how many random_snipped SNPs aren't in the dbSNP dictionary. And feel free to reach out to a TA if you have any questions about it :)
