##Exercise 1
plink --pca 3 --vcf ALL.chr21.shapeit2_integrated_v1a.GRCh38.20181129.phased.vcf.gz

##Exercise 2
There are clusters along the left side of the graph, a spread to the right, and a cluster
around zero toward the right side of the graph. This structure might suggest that SNPs a few
factors different factors, possibly such as population, correlate with the prevalence 
of certain SNPs.  

##Exercise 3
Made dictionaries with categories as keys and pc1 and pc2 as separate lists for each category.
Plotted the categories as separate series to get different colors.
Had to make the legend with the population plot with multiple rows to not cover graph.
