# day 4 homework feedback

Wonderful plots!

While you have submitted both heatmaps, I only see code creating one of the heatmaps.

 The assignment does ask you to incorporate the nested for loop and storing the power within the `run_experiment()` function rather than calling that function repeatedly. What you've done works and leads to the same conclusions, but consider how you might edit the function to incorporate the new code. While your results will be the same every time your script is run, will your results be the same compared to someone who only calls the `run_experiment()` function once therefore only sets the random seed once?

Fantastic comments and insights for your results and comparing to the real study! You could be more precise in how you describe your results. not only does there seem to be a relationship/correlation for power and number of tosses and probability of heads, but what is that relationship?
