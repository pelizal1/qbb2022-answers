## Exercise 1

Good work with the data wrangling in general! Fantastic use of the Unix tools to get done what you needed and your commands follow a logical flow. Two files seem to show up without documentation of how they were created (`counts_paternal.tsv` and `parent_age_nohead.csv`); please add that info if possible

## Exercise 2

### 1 -- data input

Good job

### 2 -- scatter plots

Good plots and labels overall! I would recommend switching your axes since you will be using this data for a linear regression and the independent variable is commonly on the x-axis and the dependent variable on the y-axis.


I don't see the code for the paternal plot. Please include if possible.

### 3 & 4 -- OLS

Good overall. Regarding the sizes for each variable relationship, you're on the right track, but consider which of your variables is the independent variable and which is the response (aka dependent variable) and reword and the size of the relationship to reflect this (please correct)

### 5 -- histogram

Good histogram!

### 6 -- ttest

great work

### 7 -- predict

Very nice use of the predict function!
