Excellent work Paul! Just a couple minor comments:
1. I think I may have misled you in office hours. I believe to actually remove new line characters, you want to do `tr -d '\n'`. But you numbers look close enough without that, anyways. (no points deducted)
2. For step 3, you probably want to check more than just the first contig in each bin. How could you systematically (i.e. with code) check the taxonomy of all contigs in a single bin? (-0.25)

Overall, great job.
