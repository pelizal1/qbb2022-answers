# Week 3 Variant Calling -- Feedback

1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 10 points out of 10 possible points

1. Index genome

  * --> +1

2. align reads

  * great! --> +1

3. sort bam files and index sorted bam files (0.5 points each)

  * good! --> +1

4. variant call with freebayes

  * fantastic! --> +1

5. filter variants

  * very good --> +1

6. decompose complex haplotypes

  * good --> +1

7. variant effect prediction

  * good --> +1

8. python plotting script

  * very good! --> +1

9. 4 panel plot (0.25 points each panel)

  * great plot overall! I like how you used the key for the variant effect plot. Alternatively, you could rotate the xtick labels and use something like `plt.tight_layout` if you tried to label them directly and had trouble fitting the words there --> +1

10. 1000 line vcf

  * very nice! And fantastic use of grep to have 1000 variant lines and the header information still --> +1
