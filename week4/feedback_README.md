You're off to a great start! Plink commands are correct, and your PCA and AF plots both look awesome! There are few more things we need from you:

1. Your manhattan plots. It looks like you have some code that might be a start on this, but it's difficult for me to tell what you're going for before it's done. Let one of the TAs or a classmate know if you need some help getting this to work. (-4 points)
2.  Your boxplot (-1.5 points)
3. Your answer to question 7 (-1 point)

Great work so far!
