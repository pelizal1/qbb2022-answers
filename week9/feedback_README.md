Really great work! Just a couple minor things:
1. Your labels for the dendrogram and heatmap are a bit funky. I think when you use the `labels` argument in the dendrogram function, it automatically rearranges the labels, and then in your heatmap, you'll need to rearrange the labels manually. (no points deducted)
2. In your qqplot, I'm not sure what the `q` line is, but I think you just want to plot a 45 degree line through y=x (no points deducted)

Really excellent job.
